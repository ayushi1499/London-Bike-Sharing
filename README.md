# London-Bike-Sharing

Urban mobility is more than just getting from point A to point B‚Äîit's about ensuring that cities are accessible, efficient, and sustainable for everyone. In today's world, analyzing data related to transportation options like bike-sharing can provide valuable insights into how people move around urban environments. By understanding the patterns and factors that influence urban mobility, we can design better infrastructure, reduce traffic congestion, improve public health, and make our cities more livable.

Bike-sharing, in particular, offers a green alternative to traditional modes of transportation, reducing carbon emissions and promoting a healthier lifestyle. Through data analysis, we can optimize bike-sharing systems, ensuring they meet the needs of residents and visitors alike. This project on London Bike Sharing aims to contribute to a broader understanding of urban mobility and support the development of smarter, more sustainable cities.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights:
